[Chorus 1]
Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is what I feel when we're together
Brighter than a lucky penny
When you're near the rain goes, disappears, dear
And I feel so fine
Just to know that you are mine

[Refrain]
My life is sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
That's how this refrain goes
So come on, join in everybody!

[Chorus 2]
Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way
When you're in love to stay

[Chorus 1]
Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is what I feel when we're together
Brighter than a lucky penny
When you're near the rain goes, disappears, dear
And I feel so fine
Just to know that you are mine

[Refrain]
My life is sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
That's how this refrain goes
So come on, join in, everybody!

[Chorus 2]
Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way
'Cause you're in love
You're in love
And love is here to stay!
