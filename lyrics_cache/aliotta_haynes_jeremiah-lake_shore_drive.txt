[Verse 1]
There's a road I'd like to tell you about, lives in my hometown
Lake Shore Drive the road is called and it'll take you up or down
From rats on up to riches, fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace help you right on by

[Chorus]
And there ain't no road just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

[Verse 2]
And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind or place you see riding on Lake Shore Drive

[Chorus]
And there ain't no road just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

[Verse 3]
And it's Friday night and you're looking clean, too early to start the rounds
A ten-minute ride from the Gold Coast back, make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day
Woo

[Chorus]
And there ain't no road just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just snaking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound
