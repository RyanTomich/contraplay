Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Señora, work it all the time

[Verse 1]
My girl's name is Señora
I tell you friends, I adore her
And when she dances, oh brother
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather

[Chorus 2]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa

[Chorus 1]
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line (Whoa)
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Señora, work it all the time

[Verse 2]
You can talk about Cha Cha
Tango, Waltz, or the Rumba
Señora's dance has no title
You jump in the saddle, hold on to de bridle

[Chorus 2]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Rock your body, child
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Somebody, help me
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa

Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time (Whoa)
Work, work, work, Señora, work your body line (Yeah)
Work, work, work, Señora, work it all the time

Señora, she's a sensation
The reason for aviation
And fellas, you got to watch it
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket

[Chorus 2]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you
(Jump in the line, rock your body) Hoist those skirts a little higher
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Up the chimney
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa

[Instrumental Break]

Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time
Dance, dance, dance, Senora, dance it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora, work it all the time

[Verse 4]
Señora dances Calypso
Left to right is the tempo
And when she gets the sensation
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion
[Chorus 2]
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Somebody, help me
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa

Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Señora
