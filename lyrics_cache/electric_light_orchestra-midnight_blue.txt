[Intro]
(Midnight blue)
(Midnight blue)

[Verse 1]
I see the lonely road that leads so far away
I see the distant lights that left behind the day
But what I see is so much more than I can say
And I see you in midnight blue

[Verse 2]
I see you cryin' now, you've found a lot of pain
And what you're searchin' for can never be the same
But what's the difference 'cause they say what's in a name?
And I see you in midnight blue (Midnight blue)

[Chorus]
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

[Verse 3]
I see you standing there far out along the way
I want to touch you, but the night becomes the day
I count the words that I am never gonna say
And I see you in midnight blue

[Chorus]
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

[Verse 4]
Can't you feel the love that I'm offering you?
Can't you see how it's meant to be?
Can't you hear the words that I'm saying to you?
Can't you believe like I believe?
It's only one and one, it's true
Still, I see you in midnight blue (Midnight blue)

[Chorus]
I see (I see) beautiful days
And I feel (I feel) beautiful ways
Of loving you, everything's midnight blue

[Chorus]
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue

[Chorus/Outro]
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue...
