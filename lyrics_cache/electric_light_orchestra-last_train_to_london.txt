[Verse 1]
It was 9:29
9:29, back street, big city
The sun was going down, there was music all around
It felt so right
It was one of those nights
One of those nights when you feel the world stop turnin'
You were standing there, there was music in the air
I should've been away, but I knew I had to stay

[Chorus]
Last train to London, just headin' out
Last train to London, just leavin' town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

[Verse 2]
It was one of those nights
One of those nights when you feel the fire is burnin'
Everybody was there, everybody to share
It was so right
There you were on your own
Lookin' like you were the only one around
I had to be with you, nothing else that I could do
I should've been away, but I knew I had to stay

[Chorus]
Last train to London, just headin' out
Last train to London, just leavin' town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Underneath a starry sky
Time was still, but hours must really have rushed by
I didn't realize, but love was in your eyes
I really should've gone, but love went on and on

[Chorus]
Last train to London, just headin' out
Last train to London (Last train to London), just leavin' town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
