[Intro]
Put me on, I'm your brand-new record album
Side one, cut one, listen to the songs
Play me loud, don't you worry 'bout your neighbors
Hope I make you feel good all day long

[Verse 1: James Young]
All day long
Put me on and play me loud
I'm the madman screaming in your living room
I'll soon be coming to your town
To sing and play a little tune

[Verse 2: James Young]
I said, "Put me on and play me loud"
Turn your stereo up all the way
All the way
Now your body's immersed in sound
So hear the synthesizers play

[Outro: Dennis DeYoung]
And now you're in the mood
Let the melody just drift your cares away
It's got to do you good
As it mesmerizes you in it's own way
So drift away, so drift away
