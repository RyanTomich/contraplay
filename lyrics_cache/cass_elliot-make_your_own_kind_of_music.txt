[Verse 1]
Nobody can tell ya
There's only one song worth singin'
They may try and sell ya
'Cause it hangs them up to see someone like you

[Chorus]
But you've gotta
Make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along

[Verse 2]
You're gonna be knowin'
The loneliest kind of lonely
It may be rough goin'
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do

[Chorus]
But you've gotta
Make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along

[Bridge]
So, if you cannot take my hand
And if you must be goin'
I will understand

[Chorus]
You've gotta
Make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along

[Outro]
You've gotta
Make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
