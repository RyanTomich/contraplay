[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, tellin' me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Takin' more than her share, had me fightin' for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shakin', the Earth was quakin'
My mind was achin', and we were makin' it

[Chorus]
And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long

[Verse 2]
Workin' double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine, all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shakin', the Earth was quakin'
My mind was achin', and we were makin' it

[Chorus]
And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long
It knocked me out that you
Shook me all night long
It had me shakin' and you
Shook me all night long

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Ah, you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you
Shook me all night long
You really got me and you
Shook me all night long

[Outro]
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long
