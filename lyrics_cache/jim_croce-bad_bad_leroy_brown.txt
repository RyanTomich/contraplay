[Intro]
Whoo

[Verse 1]
Well, the South side of Chicago is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there, you better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown
Now, Leroy, more than trouble
You see, he stands, about, six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him "Treetop Lover"
All the men just call him "Sir" (Right on)

[Chorus]
And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

[Verse 2]
Now, Leroy, he's a gambler
And he likes his fancy clothes
And he liked to wave his diamond rings in front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

[Chorus]
And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

[Verse 3]
Well, Friday, about, a week ago
Leroy's shooting dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And, ooh, that girl looked nice
Well, he casts his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson about messing
With the wife of a jealous man

[Chorus]
And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

[Bridge]
Well, the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone

[Chorus]
And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
And heâ€™s bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

[Outro]
Yeah, he was badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
