[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Everywhere the sun is shinin'
All around the world, it's shinin'
But cold winds blow across your mind

[Chorus]
Confusion (Confusion)
It's such a terrible shame
Confusion (Confusion)
You don't know what you're sayin'
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on (Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on (To lean on)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Every night, you're out there, darlin'
You're always out there runnin'
And I see that lost look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Confusion (Confusion)
I don't know what I should do
Confusion (Confusion)
I leave it all up to you
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on (Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on (To lean on)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
(Confusion, confusion)
Dark is the road you wander
(Confusion, confusion)
And as you stand there under
(Confusion, confusion)
The starry sky, you feel sad inside
(Confusion, confusion)

[Chorus]
Confusion (Confusion)
You know it's driving me wild
Confusion (Confusion)
It comes as no big surprise
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on (Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on (To lean on)

[Outro]
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
