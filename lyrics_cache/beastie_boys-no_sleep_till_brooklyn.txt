[Intro]
No sleep 'til
Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D & MCA]
Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine runnin' hotter than a boiling kettle
My job ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm a-runnin' my rhymes
On location, tourin' around the nationBeastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger, but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illin' and able
Ain't no fakin', your money I'm takin'
Goin' coast to coast to watch all the girlies shakin'
While you're at the job workin' nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kickin' it live

[Chorus]
No sleep 'til

[Post-Chorus]
Another plane, another train, another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight, another drive all night

[Verse 2: Mike D, MCA & Ad-Rock]
Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashin' hotels like it's goin' out of style
Gettin' paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezin' with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

[Chorus]
No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn

[Bridge: Ad-Rock]
Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man

[Verse 3: MCA, Mike D & Ad-Rock]
Born and bred in Brooklyn, USA
They call me Adam Yauch, but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos, arenas, and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way
Taxin' little girlies from here to LA
Wakin' up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rockin' this party eight days a week

[Chorus]
No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Yeah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (No) sleep (Sleep) 'til Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
