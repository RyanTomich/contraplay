[Verse 1]
I was caught in the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round and I knew there was no turnin' back (Thunder)
My mind raced and I thought, "What could I do?" (Thunder)
And I knew there was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns, yeah, tore me apart

[Refrain]
You've been
Thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway, broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls, some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

[Chorus]
You've been
Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Ooh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please? Yow

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Said, yeah, it's all right
We're doin' fine
Yeah, it's all right
We're doin' fine, so fine

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck (Thunderstruck)
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) You've been thunderstruck
