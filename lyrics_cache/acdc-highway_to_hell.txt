[Verse 1]
Livin' easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Askin' nothin', leave me be
Takin' everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell

[Verse 2]
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey, Satan, payin' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey, mama, look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land, wow

[Chorus]
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell

[Bridge]
Mm
Don't stop me
Hey, hey, ooh

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell) I'm on the highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell) Highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell) I'm on the highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell)

[Outro]
And I'm goin' down
All the way, woah
I'm on the highway to Hell
