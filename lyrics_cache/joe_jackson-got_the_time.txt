[Verse 1]
Wake up, got another day to get through now
Got another man to see
Got to call him on the telephone
Hey-oh, got to find a piece of paper
Sit down, got another letter to write
Think hard, got to get a letter just right
Hear a ringing on the telephone
Oh no, got to write a little later

[Pre-Chorus]
No such thing as tomorrow, only one, two, three, go

[Chorus]
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head

[Verse 2]
If I tell you what I'm doing today
Will you shut up and get out of my way?
Someone asked me what the time is, I don't know
Only know I gotta go now
No time, trying to get a watch repaired
No time, never got a thing to wear
Hear the ringin' of the telephone, no, no
Hear a ringin' in my head now

[Pre-Chorus]
No such thing as tomorrow, only one, two, three, go

[Chorus]
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
No such thing as tomorrow, only one, two, three, go

[Chorus]
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head
Tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head
Time, got the time tick
