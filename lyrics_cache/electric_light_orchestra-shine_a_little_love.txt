[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Although the things you've done, I wouldn't criticize
I guess you had your way
You see, I've gotta make you understand
[Pre-Chorus]
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say
But it don't matter, baby
'Cause today's another day

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Verse 2]
Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say it
We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you've heard it all before
But I really need you, darlin'
Every day, I need you more

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Post-Chorus]
Can you understand? (Yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right? (I know it is)
Will you be the same? (I'll do it all again)
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, ha, hoo, ha
Hoo, ha, hoo, ha, hoo

[Verse 3]
It's been a year now and it's gettin' so much better
Came home without a word
'Though everybody said, "You'll soon forget her"

[Pre-Chorus]
They couldn't see and they just didn't understand
And lookin' in the mirror
There were fools at either hand

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Post-Chorus]
Can you understand? (Yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right? (I know it is)
Will you be the same? (I'll do it all again)
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh

[Verse 4]
How many days have I been waitin' there to tell you?
I really can't believe
We're walkin' out into the world tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll do it all again until the break of light
And the feeling in your heart
Will soon be shinin' in your eyes

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
And let me see
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
Shine on me
You shine a little love on my life
Oh, oh, oh
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
And let me see (Woo)
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
Shi-i-ine
You shine a little love on my life
E-L-O
You shine a little love on my life (Woo)
And let me see (Woo)

[Outro]
Woo
