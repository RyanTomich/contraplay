[Verse 1: Joan Jett]
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he musta been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song

[Pre-Chorus: Joan Jett]
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me, singin'

[Chorus: Joan Jett & Ricky Byrd & Gary Ryan]
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

[Verse 2: Joan Jett]
He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"That don't matter," he said, "'cause it's all the same"
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"

[Pre-Chorus: Joan Jett]
And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me, singin'

[Chorus: Joan Jett & Ricky Byrd & Gary Ryan]
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus: Joan Jett]
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
And we'll be movin' on and singin' that same old song
Yeah, with me, singin'

[Chorus: Joan Jett & Ricky Byrd & Gary Ryan]
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

[Outro: Joan Jett & Ricky Byrd & Gary Ryan]
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
