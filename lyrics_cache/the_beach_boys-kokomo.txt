[Intro: Mike Love]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go?
Jamaica

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

[Chorus: All, Carl Wilson]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, Ooh, baby why don't we go?
I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo

[Post-Chorus]
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by, we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

[Chorus: All, Carl Wilson]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, Ooh baby, why don't we go?
Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo

[Post-Chorus]
Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse

[Sax Solo]

[Verse 3: Mike Love]
Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
To get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

[Outro: All, Carl Wilson]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go?
Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go?
I wanna take you down to Kokomoâ€¦
