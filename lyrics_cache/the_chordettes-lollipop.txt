[Chorus]
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop *pop*, (boom boom boom boom)

Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop *pop*, (boom boom boom boom)

[Verse 1]
Call my baby Lollipop, tell you why
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance
Man, I haven't got a chance
I call him

[Chorus]
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop *pop*, (boom boom boom boom)

[Bridge]
Sweeter than candy on a stick
Huckleberry, cherry, or lime
If you have a choice, he'd be your pick
But Lollipop is mine

[Chorus]
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop *pop*, (boom boom boom boom)

[Verse 2]
Crazy way he thrills me, yell you why
Just like a lightning from the sky
He loves to kiss me till I can't see straight
Gee, my Lollipop is great
I call him

[Chorus]
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop *pop*, (boom boom boom boom)

Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, Lollipop
Oh, Lolli-Lolli-Lolli
Lollipop, oh Lollipop
