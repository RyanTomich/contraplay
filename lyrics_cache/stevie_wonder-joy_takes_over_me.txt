[Verse 1]
You can bet you're sweeter than ever
And your love is making it better
I can feel it in my bones
Ooh, each time we're alone
I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
'Cause joy, joy, joy takes over me

[Verse 2]
Through thick and thin I'll stay
Loving you always
Yes, I need you, mama
To keep the heartaches away
I know the sun's gon' shine
As long as you're mine
'Cause joy, joy, joy, joy I feel inside

[Bridge]
Whoa-ho, oh yeah, whoa
Your love's potion
Gives me the notion
To shout out loud, oh baby, baby, baby, baby
Like a spinning top
I can't stop
Ooh, loving you
You know Stevie loves you
I need you, baby, oh-ah

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, you know my love was meant to live
And until the end
And I do believe, girl
You were meant for me
'Cause I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
That joy takes over me

[Outro]
Ooh baby, joy
Joy, joy, joy, joy
Joy joy joy joy joy joy
The way you love me, joy, baby
Takes over me
Oh, the way you love me
The way you need me
Baby, please don't leave me
I get joy, ah, woo
Joy, ah, joy, ah, hey hey hey
