[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo

[Verse 2]
You hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo, huh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amok in Kent
Lately, he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim
Huh, I'd like to meet his tailor

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo

[Verse 4]
Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the queen
Doing the werewolves of London
I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. walking with the queen, uh
Doing the werewolves of London
I saw a werewolf drinking a pi√±a colada at Trader Vic's
And his hair was perfect
Na!

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo
Werewolves of London
Huh, draw blood, uh
Ah-hoo
Werewolves of London
