[Verse 1]
I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way

[Pre-Chorus]
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Mmm, ooh, ooh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

[Chorus]
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
"Nothin' yet, you ain't been around"
That's what she told me

[Verse 2]
And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure

[Pre-Chorus]
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said

[Chorus]
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something you're never gonna f-forget, baby
You know, you know, you know, you just ain't seen nothin' yet
You need an education
Got to go to school

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Any lovin' is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said

[Chorus]
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's somethin', here's somethin'
Here's a lover you'll never forget, baby
Baby, baby, baby, you ain't seen n-n-n-n-nothin' yet
You ain't been around

[Outro]
You ain't seen nothin' yet, that's what she told me
She said I need an education
Go to school
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You got something for me when I get home
Better be good
I been everywhere
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
But I deserve it one of these days
Woo-ooh, but I ain't seen nothin' yet
I ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't seen nothin' yet
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait if you want to show me what I ain't seen
Where I ain't been
La-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
