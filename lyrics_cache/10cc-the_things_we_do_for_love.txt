[Refrain]
The things we do for love

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number
And your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down

[Refrain]
The things we do for love
The things we do for love

[Chorus]
Like walkin' in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dyin'
And you're lookin' for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooo, you made me love you
Ooo, you've gone away
Ooo, you had me crawlin' up the wall

Ohh
Ooo....

You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooo, you made me love you
Ooo, you've gone away
Ooo, you had me crawlin' up the wall
