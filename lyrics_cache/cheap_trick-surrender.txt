[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Mother told me, yes, she told me I'd meet girls like you
She also told me, "Stay away, you'll never know what you'll catch"
Just the other day, I heard of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk that's goin' 'round

[Chorus]
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Father says "Your mother's right, she's really up on things
Before we married, Mommy served in the WACS in the Philippines”
Now, I had heard the WACs recruited old maids for the war
But mommy isn't one of those, I've known her all these years

[Chorus]
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, hey, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking, where'd they disappear?
Then I woke up, Mom and Dad are rollin' on the couch
Rollin' numbers, rock and rollin', got my KISS records out

[Chorus]
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, hey, hey

[Post-Chorus]
Away
Away

[Outro]
Surrender (Mommy's alright)
Surrender (Daddy's alright)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's alright)
Surrender (Daddy's alright)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's alright)
Surrender (Daddy's alright)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Bun E.’s alright)
Surrender (Tommy’s alright)
But don't give yourself away (Robin’s alright, Rick’s alright)
Surrender (We’re all alright)
Surrender (We’re all alright)
But don't give yourself away (We’re all alright, We’re all alright)
Surrender (Mommy's alright)
Surrender (Daddy's alright)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's alright)
Surrender (Daddy's alright)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender
