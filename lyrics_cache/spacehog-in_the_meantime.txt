[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
And in the end, we shall achieve in time
The thing they call divine
When all the stars will smile for me
When all is well, and well is all for all, and forever after
Well, maybe in the meantime, wait and see

[Chorus]
(Ooh) We love the all, the all of you
Where lands are green, and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you

[Verse 2]
And when I cry for me, I cry for you
With tears of holy joy
For all the days you've still to come
And did I ever say I'd never play, or fly toward the sun
Maybe in the meantime, something's wrong

[Chorus]
We love the all, the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you

[Bridge]
That sounds fine, so I'll see you sometime
Give my love to the future of the humankind
Okay, okay, it's not okay (Ooh)
While it's on my mind, there's a girl that fits the crime
For a future love dream that I'm still to find
But in the meantime

[Chorus]
We love the all, the all of you
Where lands are green, and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you, oh-oh-oh
We love the all, the all of you
Where lands are green, and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Love the all, the all of you
Lands are green, and skies are blue
Just like you, just like you, just like, just like, just like you
Just like you, just like you, just like, just like, just like you
