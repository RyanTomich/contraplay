[Verse 1]
It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treatin' my friends
It's not in the way that you stayed 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do

[Chorus]
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
It's not in the words that you told me, yeah
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do

[Chorus]
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do

[Chorus]
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time (Love isn't always on time)
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time (Love isn't always, love isn't always on time)
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh
