[Verse 1]
Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watching you

[Verse 2]
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay
I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see?
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

[Post-Chorus]
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

[Bridge]
Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby, please

[Interlude]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see?
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

[Post-Chorus]
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make, every step you take
I'll be watching you (250)

[Outro]
I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching...
