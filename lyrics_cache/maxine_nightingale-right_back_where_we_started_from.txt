[Chorus]
Ooooo, and it's alright and it's comin' on
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Ahh-ah-ahhh

[Verse 1]
Do you remember that day
(That sunny day)
When you first came my way
I said, no one could take your place
And if you get hurt
(If you get hurt)
By the little things I say
I can put that smile back on your face

[Chorus]
Ooooo, and it's alright and it's comin' on
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Ahh-ah-hohhh-ah-hahh-hah
Mm-mm-hoo-hoo

[Verse 2]
A love like ours
(A love like ours)
Can never fade away
You know it's only just begun
You give me your love
(Give me your love)
I just can't stay away, no, no
I know you are the only one

[Chorus]
Ooooo, and it's alright and it's comin' on
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Ahh-ah-hohhh-ah-woh-huhh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Ooo ooo ooo
You give me your love
(Give me your love)
I just can't stay away, no
I know you are the only one

[Outro]
Oooo, an it's alright and it's comin' on
We gotta get it right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where we started from
It's alright and it's comin' on
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Alright and it's comin' on
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Alright and it's comin' on...
