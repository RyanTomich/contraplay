[Verse 1]
Standin' at the airport, lookin' down the strip
She was dryin' her eyes, she was bitin' her lip
Seven-four-seven
Just left from gate eleven
And there's no turning 'round
'Cause it's just leaving the ground
And gettin' higher (Higher)

[Verse 2]
Standing at the dockside, looking out to sea
When I saw her, but she did not see me
There she stood with no hope
Because she'd miss-ed the boat
And as her dreams sailed away
She headed back for the day
Back to the city (City)

[Chorus]
Night in the city, oh-oh-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city
Driving you insane

[Verse 3]
(In the city)
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la-la
In the city (City)

[Chorus]
Night in the city, oh-oh-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city
Driving you insane

[Verse 4]
I was running kinda lonely at the city place
I waited for an hour, I never saw her face
Crazy ladies that wait
And slide around like a snake
I just can't take anymore
I'm going in through the door
Into the city (City)

[Bridge]
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
Driving you insane

[Chorus]
Night in the city, oh-oh-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city
Driving you insane

[Outro]
Driving you insane
Driving you insane
