[Verse 1]
Wake up this mornin' and the paper's on the mat
Poor getting poorer and the rich are getting fat again
Up in the towers, all the bosses sittin' sneezing
A half asleep and the rest all start to squeezing tight

[Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout it, baby, don't try to understand
You got the answer in your hand
Throw it away, throw it away
Throw it away, throw it away
Throw it away

[Verse 2]
Wake up this mornin', there's a letter on the mat
Big brother wanna know where little brother's at again
Life is a piece of paper, goes on forever
Sign on the dotted line or end up in the river drowned

[Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout it, baby, don't try to understand
You got the answer in your hand
Throw it away, throw it away
Throw it away, throw it away
Throw it away

[Verse 3]
Wake up this mornin', there's a letter on the mat
Big brother wanna know where little brother's at again
Life is a piece of paper, goes on forever
Sign on the dotted line or end up in the river
Drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned
Drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned

[Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout it, baby, don't try to understand
You got the answer in your hand
Throw it away, throw it away
Throw it away, throw it away
Why don't you throw it away? Throw it away
J-just throw it away, throw it away
Throw it away
