[Verse 1]
Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'
It's magic

[Pre-Chorus]
And you, and your sweet desire
You took me, oh
Higher and higher, baby

[Chorus]
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

[Post-Chorus]
(I'm takin' a dive)
(Dive)

[Verse 2]
Making believe this is what you conceived
From your worst day (I'm takin' a dive)
Oh, moving in line, then you look back in time
To the first day (I'm takin', I'm takin')

[Pre-Chorus]
And you, and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh
Higher and higher, baby

[Chorus]
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

[Post-Chorus]
(I'm takin' a dive)
(On the slide)
(Hey!)

[Verse 3]
Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream (I'm takin' a dive)
Oh, so let her go, don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream (I'm takin', I'm takin')

[Pre-Chorus]
And you, and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh
Higher and higher, baby

[Chorus]
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
