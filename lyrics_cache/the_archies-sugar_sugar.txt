[Chorus]
Sugar
Ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Honey
Ah, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

[Verse 1]
I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
(I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling, too
(I just can't believe it's true)

[Chorus]
Ah sugar
Ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Oh, honey
Ah, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

[Verse 2]
When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be
(I know how sweet a kiss can be)
Like the summer sunshine, pour your sweetness over me
(Pour your sweetness over me)

[Pre-Chorus: Ron Dante, Toni Wine]
(Sugar) Pour a little sugar on it, honey
(Honey honey) Pour a little sugar on it, baby
I'm gonna make your life so sweet
, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pour a little sugar on it, oh, yeah
(Sugar) Pour a little sugar on it, honey
(Honey honey) Pour a little sugar on it, baby
I'm gonna make your life so sweet
, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pour a little sugar on it, honey

[Chorus]
Ah, sugar
Ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Oh, honey
Honey, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
