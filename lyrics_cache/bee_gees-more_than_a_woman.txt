[Verse 1]
Oh, girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Here in your arms, I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

[Chorus]
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

[Verse 2]
Oh, now there are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

[Chorus]
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
Hey
More than a woman (Ooh)
More than a woman to me (Oh, so much more)
More than a woman (Oh, babe)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (Oh, babe)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
