[Verse 1: Mickey Thomas]
I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

[Chorus: Mickey Thomas]
But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
Fooled around and fell in love

[Verse 2: Mickey Thomas]
It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
But when the grass got a little greener on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

[Chorus: Mickey Thomas]
But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you, baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

[Post-Chorus: Mickey Thomas]
Ooh
Oh
Oh

[Guitar Solo: Elvin Bishop]

[Verse 3: Mickey Thomas]
Free on my own, that's the way I used to be
But since I met you, baby, love's got a hold on me
(Fooled around and fell in love)
Ooh, it's got a hold on me now, yeah
(Fooled around and fell in love)
I can't let go of you, baby
(Fooled around and fell in love)
I can't stop lovin' you now
(Fooled around and fell in love)
Hey

[Outro: Mickey Thomas]
'Cause I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
I fooled around, I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around, I fooled around,  yes I did, I fooled around
I fooled around (And I fell in love), I fooled around
'Cause I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around
I fooled around, and I fell in love
Some of you know what I am trying to say
