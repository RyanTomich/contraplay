[Verse 1]
Standin' in the rain, with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold-out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day

[Verse 2]
Bought a beat-up six-string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was a one-way ticket, only one way to go

[Pre-Chorus]
So he started rockin'
Ain't never gonna stop
Gotta keep on rockin'
Someday gonna make it to the top

[Chorus]
And be a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a juke box hero
He took one guitar, (Juke box hero, stars in his eyes)
Juke box hero, (Stars in his eyes), he'll come alive tonight

[Verse 3]
In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain
And that one guitar made his whole life change

[Pre-Chorus]
Now he needs to keep a-rockin'
He just can't stop
Gotta keep on rockin'
That boy has got to stay on top

[Chorus]
And be a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)
Yeah, juke box hero, (Stars in his eyes)
With that one guitar (Stars in his eyes)
He'll come alive
Come alive tonight

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, he's gotta keep a-rockin'
He just can't stop
Gotta keep on rockin'
That boy has got to be on top

[Chorus]
And be a juke box hero, (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a juke box hero (Ahh-ahh, ahh)
Juke box hero, (Stars, stars, stars, ahh-ahh, ahh)
Juke box hero, (Stars, stars)
He's got stars in his eyes
Stars in his eyes
