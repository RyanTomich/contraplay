[Verse 1]
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

[Verse 2]
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starlessÂ 

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

[Post-Chorus]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Verse 3]
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

[Post-Chorus]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Bridge]
Taken by, taken by the sky
(Ah-ah)
Taken by, taken by the sky
(Ah-ah)
Taken by, taken by the sky
(Ah-ah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
