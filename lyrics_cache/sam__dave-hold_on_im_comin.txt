[Verse 1: Sam Moore]
Don't you ever be sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you are down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

[Chorus: Dave Prater & Sam Moore]
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

[Verse 2: Dave Prater]
I'm on my way, your lover
If you get cold, yeah, I will be your cover
Don't have to worry, 'cause I'm here
No need to suffer, baby, 'cause I'm near

[Chorus: Dave Prater & Sam Moore]
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

[Bridge: Dave Prater & Sam Moore]
Lookie here, reach out to me
For satisfaction, yeah
Lookie here, Dave, that's all she got to do
Call my name, yeah, for quick reaction
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Sam Moore]
Now don't you ever be sad
Lean on me when the times are bad
When the day comes and you are down, baby
In a river of trouble and about to drown

[Chorus: Dave Prater, Sam Moore & Both]
Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Just hold on (
Don't you worry
)
I'm comin' (
Here we come
)
Hold on (
We're about to save you
)
I'm comin' (
Yeah
)
Hold on (
Don't you worry
)
I'm comin' (
Here I come
)
